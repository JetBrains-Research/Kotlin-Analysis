## Submitting patches

The best way to submit a patch is to [fork the project on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) 
and then send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
to the `main` branch via [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you create your own fork, it might help to enable rebase by default
when you pull by executing
``` bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```
This will avoid your local repo having too many merge commits
which will help keep your pull request simple and easy to apply.
